| mode
| TEXT
| WM-Bus receiver mode
| Frequency and encoding of radio signal from devices.

| manufacturer
| TEXT
| Manufacturer
| Manufacturer of radio interface.

| serialPort
| TEXT
| Serial port
| Serial interface port.

| baudRate
| INTEGER
| Baud rate
| Baud rate for serial connection.

| dataBits
| TEXT
| Baud rate
| Data bits in each serial transmission.

| stopBits
| TEXT
| Baud rate
| Stop bits after transmission.

| parity
| TEXT
| Parity
| Parity of serial transmission.

| discoverDevices
| BOOLEAN
| Discover devices
| Turn on or off discovery of new devices for this interface.

| discoveryTimeToLive
| INTEGER
| Time to live
| Time to live (TTL) in minutes for discovered elements. After passing of TTL element will be removed, possibly re-discovered when appears again. This setting can be used to discard invalid records produced by unstable radio interface. Please note that some devices may have irregular communication schedule. Value of -1 disables time to live. Common values are 60 (one hour) and 1440 (one day).
