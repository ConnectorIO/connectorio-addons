= Bit Template

The Bit Template is a basic binary format specifier which rely on combination of hex and binary notation.
Its main purpose is definition of patterns which match byte payload.

== Template format
Templates can be constructed from four elements described in table below.

[cols="1,2,1,1"]
|===
|Name | Pattern| Size (bit count)| Notes

| Nibble
| `'0' .. '9' \| 'a' .. 'f' \| 'A' .. 'F'`
| 4
|

| Nibble variable
| `*`
| 4
| Written as `0000b`

| Bit
| `'0' .. '9' \| 'a' .. 'f' \| 'A' .. 'F'`
| 1
|

| Bit variable
| `.`
| 1
| Written as `0b`.

|===

When template is turned again into message its variable part always default to `0b`.
It is duty of caller to fill placeholders with proper values.
What is notable - writing does not have to follow variable parts.

=== Example templates

Below table list example templates and messages with their match status.

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Template | Message | Matching / Notes

| xAA xAB xAC
| AA AB AC 00
| Yes / remaining part of message is not interpreted

| xAA xAB xAC **
| AA AB AC 00
| Yes

| xAA xAB xAC **
| AA AB AB 00
| No / third byte does not match `xAC`

| xAA xAB xAC **
| AA AB AC 01
| Yes

| xAA xAB xAC **
| AA AB AC FF
| Yes

| xAA xAB xAC b0000000.
| AA AB AC 00
| Yes

| xAA xAB xAC b0000000.
| AA AB AC 01
| Yes

| xAA xAB xAC b0000000.
| AA AB AC 02
| No / bit representation of last byte is `00000010`
