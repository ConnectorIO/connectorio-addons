|===
|Name | Type | Label ^|Description

| priority
| INTEGER
| Priority
| Priority of reset command (null value sent to device). When no value is specified default channel priority is used. If no priority is set on channel then device will receive just a null.

|===
|Name | Type | Label ^|Description

| instance
| INTEGER
| Instance
| Instance number of object.

| refreshInterval
| INTEGER
| Refresh interval
| Time between next poll cycles. If no value is given polling is based on value set on Device or Network.

| writePriority

| address
| INTEGER
| Device address (node id)
| Address of device.

| instance
| INTEGER
| Device identifier
| Identifier of device.

| network
| INTEGER
| Network number
| BACnet network number/identifier.

| refreshInterval
| INTEGER
| Refresh interval
| Time between next poll cycles. If no value is given polling is based on value set on network.

| discoverChannels
| BOOLEAN
| Discover channels
| Because each BACnet object is linked to a BACnet device, device will know associated objects. Thanks to this setting it is possible to aggregate all objects states (present values) in one place. Please note this is experimental feature and works only if device channel list is empty.

| discoverObjects
| BOOLEAN
| Discover objects
| Enabling this feature will look for BACnet objects which can be mapped to Thing instances. For each supported BACnet object there will be one Thing instance. Please be aware that it most of the situations it will lead to multiplication of things.
