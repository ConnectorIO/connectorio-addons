=== Quantity Profiles

Handy conversions between numbers and quantities.

==== Quantity profile

This profile is symmetric and works on both sent and received values.
Most often it is useful in situations when a channel works with numeric value with an explicit unit which is not added by binding.
This is very common situation for Modbus and MQTT bindings which use read and write transformations.

This profile does not assume which side of communication uses quantity and which one is number based.
It will always twist value from quantity to number.
For this reason environment in which this profile is deployed must be consistent.

|Measurement unit (such as kWh, MWh) which shall be used for numeric values.
All quantities will be turned into this unit.
For example setting unit to kWH will convert 1 MWh to a number 1000.
Number 1000 will be then converted to 1000 kWh.
