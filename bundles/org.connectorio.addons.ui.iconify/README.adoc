= Iconify Icon Provider

If you ever wonder how to get iconify icons out of the box.. in openHAB.
This is the proof of concept answer.

[NOTE]
====
Because openHAB icon handling uses `-` to separate optional state description not all icon sets would work.
This is simply due to fact that iconify and many iconsets use dash as a sparator.
For that reason this icon provider accepts `_` in place of `-`.
====

Example use:

- Request path: `icon/baseline_1k.svg?iconset=ic`
- Iconify iconset 'ic', icon `baseline-1k`
