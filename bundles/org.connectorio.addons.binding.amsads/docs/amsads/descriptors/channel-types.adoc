|===
|Name | Type | Label ^|Description

| symbol
| TEXT
| Field symbol
| Name of field be read from device. For TwinCAT 2 use names such .symbol, for TwinCAT 3 use Task.Name.

| type
| TEXT
| Value encoding
| Encoding of the field. Value in brackets indicate length of type in bytes. Value FALSE or its numeric representation 0 is interpreted as OFF. Any other value is assumed to represent ON.

| inverse
