# ConnectorIO Addons

Hello friend. We would like to give you a short introduction of code present in this repository.

Code here is divided into several areas:

 * `bindings` - various kinds of connectivity extensions which adapt industrial or functional algorithms into runtime.
 ** `bacnet` - communication with BACnet® enabled HVAC equipment other commercial real estate hardware.
 ** `plc4x` - communication with industrial equipment thanks to http://plc4x.apache.org[Apache PLC4X] project.
 *** `siemens` - handling of connectivity to Step 7 (S7) enabled PLCs (coming from a certain vendor).
 *** `beckhoff` - implementation of ADS based integration for Beckhoff® PLCs.
 * `transformations` - non standard operations which might be used at the link level to implement certain functionality.
 * `telemetry` - a telemetry service for streaming data from runtime for anonymous analytics and statistical purposes.
 * `features` (distributions) - packaging of binding code.

This code is located here mainly due to "incompatible" licensing and will stay here to unify infrastructure between our bindings.
There is a shared code for `bindings` which might not be fortunate, but simplifies common operations.
Quality of code and coding style is different than in OH repositories and it is not planned to be aligned.
Please threat this repository as a source for third party addons.
