= ConnectorIO Addons

This repository contains handful set of software integrations which allow to communicate with industrial equipment.
The code which is published allow to plug various hardware (PLC, controllers, meters) to openHAB compatible solutions.
Code in this repository is maintained by *ConnectorIO sp. z o.o.*.

All together openHAB and co7io-addons allows to:

- Enable interaction between different hardware suppliers.
- Begin monitoring of manufacturing processes.
- Collect data and ingest it towards IT systems.
- Securely connect back to the hardware (without VPN client installation).

While code is divided in specific areas most ot it is present under `bundles` folder:

* `bundles` - various kinds of connectivity extensions which adapt industrial or functional algorithms into runtime.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding` - common/shared code for binding.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.askoheat` - integration of Askoheat heaters (experimental).
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.amsads` - implementation of ADS based integration for Beckhoff PLCs.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.bacnet` - communication with BACnet enabled HVAC equipment and other commercial real estate hardware.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.canbus` - generic purpose CAN bus binding (experimental).
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.canopen` - integration of CANopen enabled deployments through SocketCAN.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.canopen.ta` - integration for https://ta.co.at[Technische Alternative] hardware (it is based on CANopen).
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.plc4x` - integration with http://plc4x.apache.org[Apache PLC4X] project.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.s7` - handling of connectivity to Step 7 (S7) enabled PLCs (coming from a certain vendor).
 * `org.connectorio.addons.transformation.*` - non-standard operations which might be used at the link level to implement certain functionality.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature` - main feature package
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.amsads` - AMS/ADS deployment package
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.bacnet` - BACnet deployment package
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.canopen` - CANopen deployment package
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.plc4x` - base runtime package for integrations based upon Apache PLC4X
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.s7` - S7 deployment package
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.openhab` - All-in-one deployment package for openHAB.
 * `documentation` textual descriptions, screenshots and such needed to understand operational aspects of working with this code.

If you seek for secure VPN-less cloud solution allowing accessing any of above hardware please have a look on https://github.com/connectorio/connectorio-addons[connectorio-cloud] addon.
It allows combining multiple installations, buildings and machines across diverse geographical locations in https://app.connectorio.cloud[ConnectorIO Cloud].
This is a lightweight dashboard application for collected information.

Code refers EPLv1 and EPLv2 licensed code mainly through openHAB artifacts.

== Commercial usage
Commercial usage of this code is permitted and welcome as long as you can build binaries yourself.
We provide no binary artifacts here, if you wish to receive one please https://connectorio.com/openhab[visit our web page] and register to download them.

=== Relation to openHAB
This code is deployed independently of openHAB addons repository due to "incompatible" licensing (ASLv2 vs EPLv2).
It will stay here cause it allows us to unify infrastructure between bindings we maintain.
The shared code for `bindings` which might not be fortunate, but simplifies a lot common operations and reduces boilerplate code.
Quality of code and coding style is different from in openHAB repositories.
Code style is not planned to be aligned.

Please treat this repository as a source for third party addons.
