# ConnectorIO Addons

This repository contains code and documentation of open source industrial integrations made by *ConnectorIO sp. z o.o.*.
The code which is published allow to plug various hardware (PLC, controllers, meters) to openHAB based solutions.
All together openHAB and co7io-addons allows to:

- Interaction between different hardware.
- Monitoring of manufacturing processes.
- Data collection and ingestion towards IT systems.
- Secure remote access to hardware (without VPN client installation)

While code is divided in specific areas most ot it is present under `bundles` folder:

 * `bundles` - various kinds of connectivity extensions which adapt industrial or functional algorithms into runtime.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding` - common/shared code for binding.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.bacnet` - communication with BACnet enabled HVAC equipment other commercial real estate hardware.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.can` - core support for discovery of CAN interfaces.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.plc4x` - communication with industrial equipment thanks to http://plc4x.apache.org[Apache PLC4X] project.
 *** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.plc4x.canopen` - integration of CANopen enabled deployments through SocketCAN.
 *** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.plc4x.canopen.ta` - integration for https://ta.co.at[Technische Alternative] hardware (it is based on CANopen).
 *** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.plc4x.siemens` - handling of connectivity to Step 7 (S7) enabled PLCs (coming from a certain vendor).
 *** `org.connectorio.addons.binding.plc4x.beckhoff` - implementation of ADS based integration for Beckhoff® PLCs.
 * `org.connectorio.addons.transformation.*` - non standard operations which might be used at the link level to implement certain functionality.
 * `telemetry` - a telemetry service for streaming data from runtime for anonymous analytics and statistical purposes (not used nor implemented).
 * `features` (distributions) - packaging of binding code.
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature` - main feature package
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.bacnet` - BACnet deployment package
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.plc4x` - base runtime package for integrations based upon Apache PLC4X
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.beckhoff` - Beckhoff deployment package
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.canopen` - CANopen deployment package
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.siemens` - Siemens deployment package
 ** `org.connectorio.addons.feature.openhab` - All-in-one deployment package for openHAB.
 * `documentation` textual descriptions, screenshots and such needed to understand operational aspects of working with this code.

If you seek for secure VPN-less cloud solution allowing accessing any of above hardware please have a look on https://github.com/connectorio/connectorio-addons[connectorio-cloud] addon.
It allows combining multiple installations, buildings and machines across diverse geographical locations in https://app.connectorio.cloud[ConnectorIO Cloud].
This is a lightweight dashboard application for collected information.

### Relation to openHAB
This code is deployed independently of openHAB addons repository due to "incompatible" licensing (ASLv2 vs EPLv2).
It will stay here cause it allows us to unify infrastructure between bindings we maintain.
The shared code for `bindings` which might not be fortunate, but simplifies a lot common operations and reduces boilerplate code.
Quality of code and coding style is different from in openHAB repositories.
Code style is not planned to be aligned.

Please treat this repository as a source for third party addons.
