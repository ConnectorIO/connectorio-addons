= Installation and upgrade within {openHAB}

This page describes installation and update procedure for extension which is installed with {openHAB}.
Each ConnectorIO addon or binding comes packaged as a separate archive.
These archives have a `.kar` extension and contain extension and all dependencies needed for offline installation.
If you need to use multiple protocols you will need to repeat below procedure for each of them.

== Step-by-step guide

First of all you need working installation of {openHAB}.
Please follow official https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/[openHAB documentation] and find instructions for your hardware platform.

Once your openHAB is up and running you can proceed to installation of bindings.

1. Download selected addon.
2. Locate your {openHAB} installation.
3. Find `addons/` folder.
For linux based installations it is `/usr/share/openhab/addons`.
4. Copy KAR to this folder.
5. Launch browser.
6. Navigate to {openHAB} main user interface.
7. In left menu pick Administration > Settings.
8. Navigate to Add-ons > Bindings.
9. Find integration you plan to install by typing protocol or brand name in search box.
10. Click install and wait for operation to complete.

=== Upgrade procedure

Because there is no guarantee which version of binding will start first you need to uninstall earlier version manually.
The procedure for uninstalling is following:

1. Launch browser.
2. Navigate to {openHAB} main user interface.
3. In left menu pick Administration > Settings.
4. Navigate to Addons > Bindings.
5. Find integration you plan to update.
6. Click it or uninstall icon next to it.
7. Go to addons directory and remove selected `.kar` file.
8. Restart {openHAB}.

Do not worry about things which you created before.
Their definitions and configurations will be kept in {openHAB} database.
During upgrade, you will just lose ability to read their state.
After successful installation of new version, they should automatically be back to "online" state.

== Testing development snapshots

Testing of non released extensions is possible through manual obtaining of addon from artifact repository.
All {page-component-title} are available in "snapshot" (development) version built automatically for main versions which are maintained.

In order to download addon you need to navigate to https://repository.connectorio.cloud.

1. In left menu select "Browse".
2. Choose `co7io-public-snapshots` repository.
3. In displayed tree navigate to `org/connectorio/addons/` node.
4. Click `+` to expand node and scroll down to `org.connectorio.addons.kar....` elements.
5. Expand extension you are interested in and pick necessary version.
6. Select element with the highest number after first dash - this is build date, value after second dash is build number.
7. Mark file with `.kar` extension at the end.
8. In opened right panel click on link displayed in `Path` section marked in red on below snapshot.

Copy downloaded `kar` file and proceed with installation procedure.

[NOTE]
====
Snapshot versions are generated and can change at any time.
Retention period of artifacts might depend on many conditions.
Versions which contain `-pr-NN-SNAPSHOT` are builds for specific pull requests.
These versions might contain experimental functionality which might never arrive even in development version.
